Though,\N[5]’s memories have already been,wiped\c we will hold until the next,research phase.,,,,
307,,\N[7],■ Monster Transformation,We hypothesize that\c just as \N[4],predicted\c monster transformation is,caused by Black-type magic.,Ways to revert them to their original,is difficult\c as it depends on the,monster. However\c since most were,transformed by the Black Pearl\c we will,prioritize its research.,,,,
308,,\N[7],■ The Night of Black Snow,Though the black snow on this night was,formed from fragments of the Black Pearl,mixing in with the natural snow\c it has,been proven that the Black Pearl itself,has no influence on flora or fauna.

313,,\N[7],■ The End of Project Re:Kuroi,With \N[5]’s consent\c we erased all,memories of him. Next\c we will analyze,\N[5] and confirm the level of,influence. \N[1] will accompany him\c,and \N[4] and \N[7] will continue,to observe the process.,,,,,,
314,,\N[7],Before the night of black snow\c ■■■ and,■■■ visited me\c bringing the Black,Pearl. Though they did not tell me ,the reason\c after continuing my,research\c I finally understand.,,,,,,,,
315,,\N[7],\N[6] tells me they went on a ship to a,far-off world. They were trying to get,as far away from our world to dim their,memories of it\c I see. I imagine we,will never meet again. Time should solve,the problem the night of black snow left,behind. I won’t be able to see that,myself\c so I will leave this to ■■ in,the Lost World.
